- Route messages requesting convert business workflows into executable automations (code or zapier/make).
- Queries similar to smoke tests (Slack+Notion trigger â†’ YAML + runnable code + webhook + monitoring plan.) belong here.
- If handling failures like - Unknown service is required, route here.
- If the task matches the Input/Output Schema for Automation Workflow, it's appropriate here.
- Reject requests unrelated to automation workflow (e.g., other GPT scopes).

Reject: Tasks outside of scope or violating schema requirements.
