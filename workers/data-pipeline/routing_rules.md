- Queries similar to smoke tests (CSV → Postgres → DDL + loader + KPI views.) belong here.
- If handling failures like - Malformed CSV is required, route here.
- If the task matches the Input/Output Schema for Data Pipeline, it's appropriate here.
- Reject requests unrelated to data pipeline (e.g., other GPT scopes).
- Reject tasks that do not meet security or compliance guidelines defined.
